# DeltaBoard Documentation

The Goal of this project is to create platform for building DIY keyboard suitable for different needs. At first I'm aiming for software developer needs and general fast text editing needs

## Main Principles
- Allows fast input
- Allows smart text navigation
- Accompany Power User text editing techniques (Emacs style)
- Erginomics
- Reduce tension in wrists
- Compact (easy to transport)
- Adopt for non-English languages (Russian, Japanese)

## ToDo
- [ ] Explore Keycaps types
- [ ] Explore keyboard layouts (QWERTY, Colemak, Dvorak, Programming Dvorak, Custom)
- [ ] Explore current state. KeyStroke HeatMaps on different tasks (Software development (Haskell, C, Java, JavaScript), Book writing/Blogging, Latex)
- [ ] Explore short/average/long fingers specifics.
